# Pwnie Express: PwnPad Script to assign internal wlan hardware to "wlan0" and external wlan hardware to "wlan1".
# Revision 3.18.2013
# Authors: Grep and Awk

# Delay script starting for Android bootup
sleep 5

# Checking to see if this is the old pad or the new pad:
cat /proc/cpuinfo |grep grouper &> /dev/null

# If pad_old_or_new = 1 then current device is New Pad
if [ $pad_old_or_new -eq 1 ]; then

    # Acquire MAC address of internal wlan hardware and save as variable
    onboard_wlan_mac=`grep "^Intf0MacAddress=" /data/misc/wifi/WCNSS_qcom_cfg.ini | awk -F"=" '{print$2}' | sed -e 's/\([0-9A-Fa-f]\{2\}\)/\1:/g' -e 's/\(.*\):$/\1/'`

    # Acquire MAC address of external wlan USB adapter and save as variable
    external_wlan_mac=`busybox ifconfig -a | grep "^wlan" | grep -v "${onboard_wlan_mac}" | awk '{print$5}'`

    # Added sleep 10 in order to ensure svc commands run properly on boot - needed more time
    sleep 10

    # Disable Android wifi manager
    svc wifi disable
    sleep 2
